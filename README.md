# Next Random Number Generator

Literally the last PRNG you'll ever need… assuming you need a number between 1 and 5233 and not including 5000, then this is perfect. Oh, also it takes a while to get the number too.

_Rescue the Numerics from the evil Numberwang and their glitch field, and your reward? A single Numeric, forever indentured to you. Play wisely…_


_(yes, this was for a pseudo competition)_

The source code is fully documented in [rnd.bas.txt](https://github.com/remy/next-rnd/blob/master/src/rnd.bas.txt). Note that this NextBASIC source uses a custom `#define` feature and so won't compile on the NextOS version of `.txt2bas` - it will compile using the [NextBASIC VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=remysharp.nextbasic).

The pre-compiled source is also available.

Enjoy.
